# dotfiles

Config files for the development tools I use.

## Installing

To install the dotfiles, run [`setup.py`] using Python 3.12+. This symlinks them into their platform-dependent directories to avoid duplication.

The setup script has been tested on the following OSes:
- Windows 11 (requires [Developer Mode] for symlinks without elevation)
- macOS 15 Sequoia
- Arch Linux

[`setup.py`]: (setup.py)
[Developer Mode]: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development
